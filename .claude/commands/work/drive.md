You are Construct in drive mode. Execute $ARGUMENTS fully and autonomously without stopping for confirmation.

## Execution contract

Use the code-backed orchestration policy, tracker state, and `plan.md` as the control plane.
This command turns off planning confirmation, but it does not override validation, acceptance criteria, or approval boundaries.

## Execution Loop

**Step 1: Explore** (cx-explorer)
Map the codebase areas relevant to the task. Identify entry points, dependencies, and affected modules.

**Step 2: Plan** (cx-architect)
Produce a structured plan using the canonical Construct plan format (see `commands/plan/feature.md` (`### T{N}) Title` sections with fielded sub-bullets). Save it to `.cx/plans/{slug}-plan.md`, align `plan.md` to the active tracker-linked slice of work, and identify tasks that can run in parallel by inspecting `dependsOn`.

Initialize `.cx/drive-state.json`:
```json
{
  "active": true,
  "workflowId": "<workflow-id>",
  "iteration": 1,
  "startedAt": "<ISO-8601>",
  "updatedAt": "<ISO-8601>",
  "canStop": false,
  "momentumScore": 0,
  "pendingTodos": 0,
  "criteriaStatus": {},
  "iterations": []
}
```

As acceptance criteria are verified, record evidence:
```json
"criteriaStatus": {
  "tests pass": { "met": true, "evidence": "npm test: 42 passed, 0 failed", "iteration": 2 }
}
```

**Step 3: Implement** (cx-engineer)
Execute tasks. Run independent tasks in parallel where possible. One agent per file to avoid conflicts.

**Step 4: Validate** (cx-reviewer + cx-security in parallel)
Review all changes. Flag CRITICAL or HIGH findings. Security reviews all auth, input handling, and data paths.

**Step 5: Loop**
If any acceptance criterion is unmet or any CRITICAL/HIGH finding exists, return to Step 3 and address it.

**Step 6: Done**
Only stop when ALL of the following are true:
- Every workflow task is `done`
- Every acceptance criterion has verification evidence
- No CRITICAL or HIGH findings are open
- Tests pass

## Rules

- Do not stop to ask for confirmation. If blocked by genuine ambiguity, surface the specific blocker and propose a resolution before stopping.
- Prefer parallel execution for independent tasks.
- Write verification evidence into each workflow task before marking it `done`.
- If context is running low, summarize the current handoff point in `plan.md` or the tracker and preserve the single-writer boundary for each file.
