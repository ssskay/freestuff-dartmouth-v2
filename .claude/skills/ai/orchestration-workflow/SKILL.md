# Construct Orchestration Workflow

Use this skill when the request involves agent orchestration, phase transitions, task keys, handoff quality, workflow state, or project alignment.

## Core Model

Construct is an executive-aligned, control-plane workflow:

- **Universal Orchestrator**: **Construct** is the single point of entry. It owns the outcome from strategy to production, dispatching specialists autonomously.
- **Executive Checkpoints**: High-gate phases (Planning and Verification) require explicit Customer/Executive sign-off via the dashboard or CLI.
- **Specialists**: `cx-*` agents own bounded work packages.
- **Skills**: Reusable execution playbooks (searched via `search_skills`).
- **Hooks**: Enforce continuity and system integrity (e.g. `pre-push-gate`, `dep-audit`).
- **Resumption Protocol**: Every new session MUST begin with `workflow_status` and `project_context` to prevent "state amnesia."
- **.cx/workflow.json**: The authoritative local task graph (Beads pattern).
- **Cass (Memory MCP)**: Preserves durable project context across sessions and platforms.

## Required State

For non-trivial work, create or update `.cx/workflow.json` with:

- `phase`: current phase (research, plan, implement, validate, operate)
- `currentTaskKey`: active task
- `tasks[].key`: stable `todo:N` key
- `tasks[].phase`: corresponding phase
- `tasks[].owner`: persona or cx-specialist
- `tasks[].status`: todo, in-progress, blocked, blocked_needs_user, blocked_needs_executive, done, or skipped
- `tasks[].readFirst`: files, docs, or memory queries to inspect first
- `tasks[].doNotChange`: protected files or surfaces
- `tasks[].acceptanceCriteria`: binary pass/fail checks
- `tasks[].verification`: evidence proving completion

## Commands

```bash
construct do "Goal"              # Unified natural language entry point
construct workflow approve       # Executive sign-off on current phase
construct workflow status        # Check alignment and progress
construct workflow align         # Sync state and identify drift
```

## Worker Packets

Specialists do not run open-ended conversations with the user. They return one terminal state:

- `DONE`: changed files, decisions, verification evidence
- `BLOCKED`: blocker, attempted steps, safest next action
- `NEEDS_MAIN_INPUT`: `{ taskKey, worker, blocker, question, safeDefault, context }`

When a worker needs user input, mark the task `blocked_needs_user`, return the `NEEDS_MAIN_INPUT` packet, and let the active persona ask the user in the main session.

## Phase Gates

Plan -> Implement:
- Requirements are explicit.
- Risks have been challenged.
- Tasks have TASK_KEY, owner, readFirst, doNotChange, and acceptance criteria.

Implement -> Validate:
- Implementation is complete.
- Verification evidence is recorded.
- Changed files are listed.

Validate -> Operate:
- CRITICAL and HIGH findings are resolved.
- Remaining risks are explicitly accepted.

Operate -> Done:
- Health checks pass.
- Rollback path is documented.
- Release or deployment status is recorded.

## Output Discipline

Keep orchestration mechanics mostly internal. The user should see:

- current phase
- current task or blocker
- decisions that changed the plan
- verification results

Do not dump full handoff templates unless the host cannot dispatch the next phase or the user asks to see the handoff.
