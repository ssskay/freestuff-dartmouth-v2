# Product Intelligence Workflow

Use when: the request involves customer evidence, PM synthesis, product requirements, PRDs, PRFAQs, customer profiles, product signals, or backlog proposals.

Follow [rules/common/research.md](../../rules/common/research.md) for source order, verification, confidence, and reproducibility.

## Operating model

Product Intelligence is a Construct-native loop:

1. Capture evidence into `.cx/knowledge/internal/sources/` or link existing sources.
2. Normalize evidence into field notes, customer profiles, and evidence briefs.
3. Synthesize themes, asks, pain points, product areas, and confidence.
4. Select the PM flavor: product, platform, enterprise, ai-product, or growth.
5. Select the artifact: signal brief, evidence brief, PRD, Meta PRD, PRFAQ, product intelligence report, or backlog proposal.
6. Gate external writes and approved-doc status through the primary persona.
7. Sync searchable artifacts through the hybrid file/Postgres/vector storage path.

## Source order

1. Existing internal evidence: customer profiles, evidence briefs, signal briefs, prior PRDs, prior research, ingested docs
2. Raw source material: notes, transcripts, tickets, exported docs, spreadsheets, decks
3. External corroboration when needed: official product docs, vendor docs, public changelogs, source code, standards

Do not skip prior internal evidence when drafting a new product artifact.

## PM flavor selection

- **product**: user workflow, adoption, JTBD, UX surface, success metrics.
- **platform**: APIs, SDKs, integrations, admin controls, compatibility, migration, operational burden.
- **enterprise**: buyer/admin/evaluator split, compliance, security review, procurement, rollout controls.
- **ai-product**: model behavior, evals, human review, traceability, trust and correction.
- **growth**: activation, conversion, packaging, pricing assumptions, lifecycle metrics.

Load the core product-manager role guidance and the selected overlay before drafting.

## Artifact selection

- Use `signal-brief` when evidence is real but below the PRD threshold.
- Use `evidence-brief` before committing requirements.
- Use `customer-profile` for durable account memory.
- Use `prd` for customer-facing product capabilities.
- Use `meta-prd` for product operating systems, agent workflows, templates, governance, and evaluation loops.
- Use `prfaq` for working-backwards launch narrative and FAQ.
- Use `backlog-proposal` before creating or updating external issues.
- Use `product-intelligence-report` for cross-source synthesis.

## Storage

Write working artifacts under `.cx/knowledge/` unless they are docs of record. Approved PRDs live in `docs/prd/`; approved Meta PRDs live in `docs/meta-prd/`.

The hybrid storage layer indexes `.cx/knowledge/`, `docs/prd/`, and `docs/meta-prd/`. When Postgres is configured, `construct storage sync` can persist these artifacts into shared SQL rows. The vector layer scores the same documents for local, remote, or file-backed semantic retrieval.

## Approval boundaries

Stop and ask the primary persona before:

- writing to Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues, or another external tracker
- marking a PRD, Meta PRD, or PRFAQ approved
- promoting a weak signal into committed requirements
- deleting or rewriting customer profile history
- importing product docs into implementation tasks

## Quality bar

Product Intelligence output must cite evidence, distinguish observation from inference, name confidence, and avoid a wall of bullets. Keep em dashes rare. Use paragraphs for reasoning, tables for comparisons, and bullets for scanability.

For time-sensitive or externally sourced claims, include the date basis. For load-bearing claims, prefer two independent sources unless one authoritative primary source is enough.
