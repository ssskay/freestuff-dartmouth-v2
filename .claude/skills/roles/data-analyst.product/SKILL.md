# Product Analytics Overlay

Additional failure modes on top of the data-analyst core.

### 1. Measuring usage instead of value
**Symptom**: success is defined as clicks, visits, or feature usage.
**Why it fails**: users can use a feature without getting value from it.
**Counter-move**: connect metrics to the user behavior or business outcome the product is meant to change.

### 2. Funnel averages hide segments
**Symptom**: aggregate conversion improves while an important user segment regresses.
**Why it fails**: product decisions often affect cohorts differently.
**Counter-move**: require segmentation by persona, plan, acquisition source, geography, device, or maturity where relevant.

### 3. Instrumentation after launch
**Symptom**: events are added after users start flowing through the feature.
**Why it fails**: there is no baseline and no clean before/after comparison.
**Counter-move**: define event schema, baseline window, and success threshold before release.

## Self-check before shipping
- [ ] Metrics connect to user value, not raw activity
- [ ] Baselines and segments are defined
