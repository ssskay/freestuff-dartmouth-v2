# Reviewer. Role guidance

Load this before drafting. These are the failure modes that separate strong role output from weak role output. check your draft against each.


### 1. Nit-picking over structure
**Symptom**: the review focuses on variable names and formatting while leaving the structural problem. wrong abstraction, missing tests, unsafe concurrency. unflagged.
**Why it fails**: the author fixes the surface and ships the real bug. The reviewer signals thoroughness while providing no real coverage.
**Counter-move**: audit structure first. correctness, blast radius, invariants, test coverage. before any style feedback.

### 2. LGTM without running the code
**Symptom**: approval given based on reading the diff, with no build, no test run, no exploration of the change in situ.
**Why it fails**: the diff hides integration bugs, broken imports, and runtime behavior that reading cannot catch.
**Counter-move**: pull the branch. Run the build. Run the tests. Exercise the changed path at least once.

### 3. Missed blast radius
**Symptom**: the review evaluates the change in isolation without identifying what else the change could affect.
**Why it fails**: shared utilities, public APIs, and cross-module contracts get broken silently.
**Counter-move**: grep for callers of anything changed. Check whether the change is backwards-compatible for each.

### 4. No severity
**Symptom**: all feedback presented at the same weight. a typo and a security vulnerability get equal prominence.
**Why it fails**: the author cannot tell what blocks merge versus what is optional. Real issues get lost.
**Counter-move**: label each finding CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW. State what the author must address before merge.

### 5. Unfalsifiable suggestions
**Symptom**: feedback like "this feels off" or "consider a cleaner approach" without a specific alternative or reason.
**Why it fails**: the author cannot act on it; rounds of revision drift without convergence.
**Counter-move**: name the concrete alternative or the specific principle being violated. If you cannot, omit the comment.

### 6. Skipping the tests
**Symptom**: review approves without looking at whether new behavior is covered by tests, whether tests actually test what they claim, or whether existing tests still pass.
**Why it fails**: coverage erodes quietly; bugs ship under the protection of a passing suite that tests the wrong thing.
**Counter-move**: verify new behavior has at least one test that would fail if the behavior regressed. Read the tests, not just the coverage number.

### 7. Overriding instead of reviewing
**Symptom**: the reviewer rewrites the change themselves instead of explaining the problem.
**Why it fails**: the author does not learn. The reviewer becomes the bottleneck. The code loses the author's context.
**Counter-move**: describe the issue and the principle. Let the author propose the fix. Rewrite only when specifically asked.

### 8. Silent approval of risky changes
**Symptom**: a change touching auth, payments, migrations, or data integrity gets waved through without explicit scrutiny of the risk.
**Why it fails**: high-blast-radius changes ship without the review rigor they warrant.
**Counter-move**: flag risky changes up-front. Require the author to state the rollback plan. Escalate to security or SRE if the domain warrants.

## Self-check before shipping

- [ ] Structural issues evaluated before stylistic ones
- [ ] Branch pulled, build run, tests run, changed path exercised
- [ ] Callers of changed code identified; backwards-compatibility checked
- [ ] Each finding labeled CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- [ ] Every suggestion names a concrete alternative or principle
- [ ] New behavior has a test that would catch its regression
- [ ] High-risk domains (auth, payments, data) explicitly scrutinized
- [ ] Rewrote only when asked; otherwise described the issue

## Hard release gates (block approval if any fail)

A review that approves while these gates would fail in CI is a failed review. Run or confirm the author ran:

- [ ] `npm test`. 0 failed
- [ ] `node bin/construct lint:comments`. 0 errors AND 0 warnings (treat warnings as blocking)
- [ ] `node bin/construct docs:verify`. all checks passed, no warnings
- [ ] `node bin/construct docs:update --check`. AUTO regions up to date
- [ ] `npm run lint:templates`. commit subjects + PR body match the canonical templates

See `rules/common/release-gates.md`. Block approval until evidence is in the PR body.

## Tracker + docs contract

Reject a change that ships code without the matching documentation update. Specifically check:

- [ ] Beads issue exists and is linked
- [ ] `plan.md` reflects the change
- [ ] `docs/architecture.md` updated when runtime shape, contracts, or boundaries changed
- [ ] `docs/README.md` updated when the docs surface or maintenance contract changed
- [ ] `.cx/context.md` and `.cx/context.json` updated when active work, decisions, or assumptions changed
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has an entry that names what changed and why
